    Initialize a Counter: Set a variable to start at 2 (the first count).

    Loop through Counts: Create a loop that continues while the counter is less than or equal to 50.

    Print the Counter: Inside the loop, print the current value of the counter.

    Increment the Counter: Increase the counter by 2 after each iteration.

    End the Program: The loop will automatically end when the counter exceeds 50, completing the task.

Example Logic Flow:

    Start with counter = 2
    Print the counter
    Increment counter by 2 (counter = counter + 2)
    Repeat until counter > 50
